## All functions & activities within the Circle

### Policy: Dependency resolution
The assignee should resolve any emerging dependency for the current week.

### Policy: Estimation
Next week's commitment is reestimated by the team before the demo, 
taking the roadmap into account.
UI tasks' estimation must be based on existing and approved mockups.
If a UI task has backend dependencies, then the backend and frontend tasks must be defined in
separate tasks in the same user story.
If there is lack of information to estimate a user story, then estimation is
forbidden and has to be marked.

### Policy: Development process
- To do
- In progress
- Done
- Reviewed

### Policy: JIRA usage
We set the assignee and the assigner, we discuss and clarify all the AC. 
We add external dependencies as tasks for the Emarsys staff. 
If you find a bug add it to JIRA backlog.

### Policy: Definition of well-defined
A well defined task should:
- have acceptance criteria
- contain only one UI component
- have mockups

### Policy: Definition of done
A card only can move to done if:
- there are integration tests about the acceptance criteria
- unit test coverage is almost 100%
- deployed to stage and production
- AC is manually tested on production
- reviewed by other
- works in local
- doesn't break the build
- you informed the others about the breaking changes

### Policy: QA
Every task must have someone who will assure its quality. 
He/She has to check on the staging environment whether all AC are met. 
Every task have to be QA-d by its assigner in JIRA with special attention to edge cases.
